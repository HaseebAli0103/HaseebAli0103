# Hi, I'm Haseeb Ali! ðŸ‘‹

Passionate about cybersecurity and actively pursuing a career as a **Security Analyst**. Welcome to my GitHub space, where I explore, learn, and apply fundamental security concepts and practical skills.

I'm dedicated to understanding the intricacies of digital defense and am currently seeking opportunities to contribute to dynamic security teams.

### About Me & My Journey

My fascination with the digital world, and more specifically its "magic" and vulnerabilities, started early. I still remember the day my brother's computer was hit by a virus, wiping out everything â€“ including my favorite cars in my favorite game! When he later restored the game, making all the expensive cars available for free, he simply called it "magic." This sparked my initial curiosity about what happens behind the scenes.

Later, witnessing friends' game accounts get hacked solidified my resolve: I wanted to understand how these digital events unfold and, more importantly, how to prevent them. Since then, my primary goal has been to contribute to a safer digital environment.

This journey led me to gain a strong foundation from the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**, where I acquired comprehensive knowledge in critical areas such as:

* **Security Models & Frameworks:** Understanding and applying principles from NIST CSF, ISO 27001, and compliance standards like HIPAA.
* **Network Security:** In-depth understanding of the TCP/IP model, network protocols, and how networks function securely.
* **Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities:** Identifying and mitigating potential security weaknesses.

I believe in hands-on learning and am constantly working to translate theoretical knowledge into practical skills.

### Skills & Tools

I'm comfortable working with a variety of tools and technologies essential for a Security Analyst:

* **Operating Systems:** Proficient in **Linux** (4+ years of experience) and familiar with Windows environments.
* **Virtualization:** Experienced with **VMware** and **VirtualBox** for creating isolated lab environments.
* **Containerization:** Familiar with **Docker** for deploying and managing applications.
* **Scripting:** Capable of automating tasks using **Python**.
* **Security Tools:**
    
    - **Network Scanning:** In-depth hands-on experience with **Nmap** for comprehensive network discovery and vulnerability assessment.
        
    - **Traffic Analysis & Interception:** Foundational understanding and initial exploration of tools like **Wireshark** (network traffic analysis), **tcpdump** (packet capture), and **Burp Suite** (web vulnerability testing).
        
    - **Wireless Security:** Basic familiarity with **Aircrack-ng** for wireless network assessments.
